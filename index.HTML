<h2 style="color: blue;">Love Someone lyrics</h2>

<p>There are days <br> I wake up and I pinch myself <br> You're with me, not someone else <br> And I am scared, yeah, I'm still scared <br> That it's all a dream</p>

<p>'Cause you still look perfect as days go by <br> Even the worst ones, you make me smile <br> I'd stop the world if it gave us time</p>

<p>'Cause when you love someone <br> You open up your heart <br> When you love someone <br> You make room <br> If you love someone <br> And you're not afraid to lose 'em <br> You probably never loved someone like I do <br> You probably never loved someone like I do</p>

<p>When you say <br> You love the way I make you feel <br> Everything becomes so real <br> Don't be scared, no, don't be scared <br> 'Cause you're all I need</p>

<p>And you still look perfect as days go by <br> Even the worst ones, you make me smile <br> I'd stop the world if it gave us time</p>

<p>'Cause when you love someone <br> You open up your heart <br> When you love someone <br> You make room <br> If you love someone<br> And you're not afraid to lose 'em <br> You probably never loved someone like I do <br> You probably never loved someone like I do</p>

<p>All my life <br> I thought it'd be hard to find <br> The one 'til I found you <br> And I find it bittersweet <br> 'Cause you gave me something to lose</p>

<p>But when you love someone <br> You open up your heart <br> When you love someone <br> You make room <br> If you love someone <br> And you're not afraid to lose 'em <br> You probably never loved someone like I do <br> You probably never loved someone like I do <br> You probably never loved someone like I do</p>
